![sailfish jumping](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0fDZGf4DpQ5i/giphy.gif)

The Sailfish programming language is an experimental project I am undertaking during my Junior Spring as part of my compiler independent study under Professor Dale Skrien at Colby College. This is the initial version, a dirty version that will be used for bootstrapping.

## Sailfish Wiki
I will be regularly updating the wiki with docs, grammar, code snippets, sailfish philosophy, version notes, etc. So travel on over [there](https://github.com/robertDurst/sailfish/wiki) to learn more.
